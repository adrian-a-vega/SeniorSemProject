# Comparison of Neural Network Architecture in Machine Learning with Language Translation
## Purpose
- Language is cruitial throughout transactions, conversations, learning, media, and everday tasks. Although, the varitiy languages creates barriers between dialects and cultures. An example is within the medical field, health care workers face with issues when a patient is unable to speak predominate dialect of the country. As a resolution, the medical field hire translators to help the patient communicate their thoughts to the workers. A modernized solution is using machine learning (ML) as a replacement, or placeholder, for translators. Although, ML models have several options for algorithms and architectures which effect their efficiency. So, What algorithm and architecture are best for language translation?
